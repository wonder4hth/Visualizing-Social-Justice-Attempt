# Visualizing Social Justice â€“ Data Pipeline & FSM Visualization

This repository contains experimental work developed during an internship project focused on **social justice data analysis**.  
The project integrates **web scraping**, **finite state machine (FSM) modeling**, and **visualization** to explore patterns and communicate findings.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

### 1. Data Collection â€“ Web Scraping
- Automated collection of structured and semi-structured data from multiple online sources.
- Techniques:
  - `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for HTML parsing
  - Handling pagination, dynamic content, and anti-scraping measures
  - Exporting data to CSV/JSON for further processing

### 2. Analysis & Visualization â€“ FSM & Plots
- Built finite state machine models to represent state transitions in the dataset.
- Visualized state transitions and related metrics using:
  - `matplotlib` and `networkx` for FSM diagrams
  - `seaborn` and `plotly` for statistical and interactive visualizations

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Outcomes
- Developed a full pipeline from **data acquisition â†’ modeling â†’ visualization**.
- Created visual narratives to support policy discussions and advocacy.
- Experimented with both static and interactive visualization formats.
